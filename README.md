build a great, yet simple library for the long run.

## [Donations](https://github.com/sponsors/dashvars)

[Support the project on the Dashvar GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/dashvars).

The project is maintained, time and financially wise, by me ([Carlos Baraza](https://carlosbaraza.com)). I live in London, UK. And I strive to create an organization that can return some value to society in the best way I know how, technology.

Unfortunately, creating Open Source Software, although a great philanthropic exercise for the mind and the soul, has some disadvantages in comparison with proprietary software. I would love to continue providing value, and your contribution really makes a difference, even if it is really small.

The funds will be used to maintain and create useful projects for the development community.
