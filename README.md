## Contributing

Please, we welcome any contributions to the project. Together, we can
build a great, yet simple library for the long run.

## Donations

Dashvar aims to provide a simple design system to accelerate and facilitate the rapid development of user interfaces.

It will always be Open Source. However, in order to maintain the project, we'd need to find a sustainable income stream, mostly to cover our time investment to bring this hopefully useful project to you.

We would really appreciate your support. Any donation will make a big difference.
