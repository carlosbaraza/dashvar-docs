A spacing system is one of the most useful things you can take away from Dashvar library. It's incredibly
useful to limit the choices you have to make when designing a UI, because you can be certain that every size increase or decrease will actually make a difference.

Another great benefit that comes with using a sizing system is that your UIs and code will be more consistent and clean. Vertical and horizontal rhythms will be respected, and that has an impact over the look and feel of your interface.
